This site is running the Cities Lost platform. If you're seeing this
page when loading the site, you should create a new page for your
city, and change [[MediaWiki:Mainpage]] to point to that page instead
of this one.

This platform consists of 2 parts:

* A wikipedia-like site (running MediaWiki) where contributors can easily add and edit information about places lost.

* An interactive map with search and filtering.
